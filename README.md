# Informing Police Investigation Strategies through Network Analysis

In this project we propose a novel network algorithm to model the way police may investigate an unknown criminal network. We simulate this model over a number of real world covert criminal networks to discover that indeed police forces could benefit from leveraging network characteristics to improve the investigative success of their efforts. The findings are detailed in the paper CriminalNetworks_AmpudiaLeungLovicu.pdf. The main finding are the particular network characteristics that has led cell structure like networks such as Al Qaeda to be so successful in avoiding capture. We show a way of using an unintuitive strategy of balancing depth and breadth first search that successfully improves the success rate of capturing the Al Qaeda network. The work was undertaken and completed collaboratively with David Ampudia and Gigi Lovicu.
