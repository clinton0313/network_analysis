#Running list of things to be done. Please amend and add. 

-Explore statistics and properties of networks
-Gather metadata of networks
-Integrate network attributes into networks
-Get more networks?


#Potential (Ambitious) Roadmap

1) Show that networks can be discriminated
2) Show that different algorithmns potentially work better for different network types
3) Show that sub-samples can infer network type
4) Can we create a feedback loop to improve upon strategies
